# continuous-bible-plans

Reading the Bible is a daily discipline, most reading plans have start and end dates and when they are done you have to either choose a new plan or start the old one again. The plans that are generated by this site will automatically loop back when each track is done.

In a multi-track plan that also gives you the added benifit of reading different parts of the Bible together when tracks loop back if they are all different lengths.
