# continuous-bible-plans

Reading the Bible is a daily discipline, most reading plans have start and end dates and when they are done you have to either choose a new plan or start the old one again. Each track of the plan will automatically loop back on itself when it's done.

In a multi-track plan that gives you the added benifit of reading different parts of the Bible together as each track loop back around at different lengths.
